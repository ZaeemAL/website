I applied to Ph.D. in Economics/Public Policy/Business Administration programs for Fall'24, and did not have the worst outcome. I was lucky to receive guidance from many, which I have collated [here](https://sites.google.com/view/zaeemalehsan/ph-d-applications).

Schedule a call with me [here](https://calendly.com/phdapplications/30min) if you want me to review your profile, read your SOP, and offer my two cents.
